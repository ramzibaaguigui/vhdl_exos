Exercise 16.13:

Modify the push-and-pull system of Section 16.8.1 using the two-phase handshaking
protocol (additional data lines are needed). Derive the revised block diagram and VHDL
code.

modify the system, make it a two-phase handshaking protocol 

We will design a system that can do push-or-pull between the talker and the listener
with a two-phase sync req-ack protocol

1) we start with the definition of the interfaces that are needed to connected the two components
