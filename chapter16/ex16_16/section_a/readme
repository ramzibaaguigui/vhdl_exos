16.16 Consider the one-phase pull operation in Section 16.8.3. Derive VHDL code for
the sending and receiving subsystems with the following clock rates.
(a) fsend = 10 MHz and freceive = 10 MHz

one phase pull operation

The design is normally accurate 
you should consider simulating the entire staff before
