16.16 Consider the one-phase pull operation in Section 16.8.3. Derive VHDL code for
the sending and receiving subsystems with the following clock rates.

(b) fsend = 10 MHz and freceive = 2.5 MHz

the sender will enable the req for twenty cycles, 
recover the result from the data bus at the end of 
the 19th cycle (recalculations may be required)

for the received, once the req_in is asserted, 
wait one cycle to go to the idle state in which
it can receive subsequent requrests

the solution will build on the previous one, with some little changes
