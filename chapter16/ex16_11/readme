This exercise requires extensive coding,
This is why we have specified an entire folder for the different modules


The exercise tells us that the operand width is 8 bits
In fact, the multiplier needs two bit operands
To make the things simple, let turn the multiplier into a unit that calculates 
the operand raised to the power of 2
a_in and b_in will receive the same value

Note that the goal of this exercise is the communication protocol that is established
between the different units
