16.17 Consider the FIFO buffer of Section 16.9.1, and let the clock periods of the writing
and reading subsystems be Tw, and Tr, respectively. Assume that the sending subsystem
has 10 words to pass through the FIFO buffer. Determine the total time to complete the
operation with the following buffer sizes:
(a) One word.
(b) two words.
(c) Four words.
(d) Eight words.
(e) 16 words


----------------------------------
We will write the code from the book
try to understand its timing and finally 
make some conclusions concerning the time 
it takes to transfer 10 words in the different
cases listed above
