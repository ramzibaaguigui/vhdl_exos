The talker and the listener both have the same frequencies
we will do a simple timing analysis for the time required to 
receive the req signal and recover the data to the internal registers

(a)   sender frequency = 10  MHz
    receiver frequency = 2.5 MHz

the sender is faster than the receiver
the sender has to wait for some more states to make sure that the receiver received the data
