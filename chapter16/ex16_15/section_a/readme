The talker and the listener both have the same frequencies
we will do a simple timing analysis for the time required to 
receive the req signal and recover the data to the internal registers

(a)   sender frequency = 10 MHz
    receiver frequency = 10 MHz

we can roughly say that two clock cycles are required for the syncronization of the req signal 
another clock cycle is needed to recover the data from the data line
-- the design will target the push operation only
