Exercise 16.15:
Consider the one-phase push operation in Section 16.8.3. Derive VHDL code for
the sending and receiving subsystems with the following clock rates.
(a) = 10 MHz and freceive = 10 MHz
(b) fsend = 10 MHz and freceive = 40 MHz
(c) fsend = 10 MHz and freceive = 2.5 MHz

this type of questions requires a rigorous information, 
if there is one piece of information to get from this, it would be the fact that we understand the principle 
sometimes, especially in the field of digital design, 
some things need a pencil and a sheet of paper, or simply a white board to get thigns done
as fast as possible
